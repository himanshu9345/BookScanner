# BookScanner


- This application allows user inventory his books.                                                                                          
- The user will scan barcode from the book and then type in the
information about that book, such as title, author, number of pages, and whether or not he/she has read it.                                
- I have used Google Books Api to get the Books from based on ISBN number.                                                                   
- I have used SQLite Databse to store user added book information.
